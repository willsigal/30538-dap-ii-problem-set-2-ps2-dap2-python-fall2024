## Data cleaning continued (15 points)

1.**(For each column, how many rows are NA? Write a function which returns a two column
data frame where each row is a variable, the first column of the data frame is the name
of each variable, and the second column of the data frame is the number of times that
the column is NA. Test your function. Then, report the results applied to the parking
tickets data frame. There are several ways to do this, but we havenâ€™t covered them yet
in class, so you will need to work independently to set this up.)**
